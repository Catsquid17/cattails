      <p>
        One day this page might have something really cool on it. But it's not done yet and won't be for a while. This page uses a lot of JS, so it has to be a live site to work properly. 
        But to make that private I'd have to pay money OR I'd have to like build the site with local hosting and then transfer it here when I'm ready. Which would probably be fine. But I don't feel like doing that. 
        So I'm just going to build it on this live, technichally-public site and just redact anything that would spoil my super awesome project.
