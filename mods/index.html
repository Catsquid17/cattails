    this page is going to show cards of all my mods but i have to think of how i want to do that... im thinking of this page and maybe also the front page being populated by JS so i don't wanna jump the gun on building it out before i decide that.
    maybe i can make the ids the name of the mod i want in a particular spot and some js will do the rest? would be particuarly good for the front page, which i currently have as a list of recent mods but i think i would prefer it to be three
    FEATURED mods... like i have a christmas mod i want to be able to advertise it during christmas!!!
